### Huffman Code
The Huffman Code is an algorithm for performing data compression and decompression. The program works by converting the characters in a text file into binary, or by converting binary in a text file into characters. 

 , which reduces the quantity of memory required to represent the characters contained within the file. 

The encoding phase works by reading in a text file, creating a unique prefix code for each character based off of the frequency of the character, and converting the text file from strings to bits. This will reduce the total quantity of memory necessary to represent the text file. The decoding phase works by creating a huffman tree using the characters and their respective prefix codes. The program will then read in prefix codes to
