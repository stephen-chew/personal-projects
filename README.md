### Huffman Code
The Huffman Code is an algorithm for performing data compression and decompression. The purpose of the code is to convert characters in a text file into binary, or to convert binary in a text file into characters. 

The advantage of converting the characters in a text file into binary is to reduce the quantity of memory required to represent the characters contained within the file.
