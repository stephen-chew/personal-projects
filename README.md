### Huffman Code
The Huffman Code is an algorithm for performing data compression and decompression. The purpose of the code is to convert characters in a text file into binary, or to convert binary in a text file into characters. 

The advantage of converting the characters in a text file into binary is to reduce the quantity of memory required to represent the characters contained within the file.

### UFO Game
The UFO Game is a word game. Users are presented with a blank codeword, and their objective is to guess all the letters in the codeword. If the user enters in 6 incorrect guesses, the game ends and the user loses. If the user is able to correctly guess every letter in the code word, the game ends and the user wins.
